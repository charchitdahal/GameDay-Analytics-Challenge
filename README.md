# GameDay Analytics Challenge

# Introduction

The Super Bowl is widely recognized as one of the world's most viewed live sports events. With millions of viewers tuning in from across the globe, it presents an ideal platform for brands to showcase their brands and services. This white paper aims to share insights about Super Bowl LVII advertisements as part of the Game Day Analytics competition at the University of Utah. Our study tries to understand the performance of advertisements, brand representation, and social media engagements, among other valuable metrics. The findings presented here will help marketers, advertisers, and educators get insight into the landscape of advertisement in this year’s Super Bowl.  

# Methods 

The analytics competition organizers provided us with the Twitter dataset, which comprised a dataset of 2 million tweets taken during the Super Bowl. The data was divided into digestible bits using a python program, and it was ready to be uploaded to Domo, a data management and analytics platform. An extract, transform, and load (ETL) procedure was created in Domo to aggregate and clean the data, preparing it for analysis. 

Domo’s robust analytics tools were used to create time series plots, word clouds, and geolocation maps, among others, to examine the data. These cards were used to uncover trends and insights into the data, including engagement levels, popular brands, and even celebrity influence. Lastly, the findings were displayed in a variety of visually appealing and educational visualization tools, which offered insights into the Super Bowl LVII advertising scene.
